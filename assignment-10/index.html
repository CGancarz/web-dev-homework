        <p>Jamie O'Rourke was the laziest man in all of Ireland. He would do anything to avoid working, especially if it had to do with growing potatoes.
          <span class="spoken">"Jamie O'Rourke!,"</span> his wife, Eileen, would say. <span class="spoken">"We'll have nothing to eat this winter if you don't go out and dig up the praties."</span>

        <p><span class="spoken">"Oh, the Saints prserve us,"</span> Jamie would whine.<span class="spoken">"Me back's as sore as can be. Sure as I'm tellin' you, wife, you'll have to dig them up yourself. I'll break in two if I so much as get up out of this bed."</span></p>
      </div>

          <div class="divider"></div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>So Eileen, who had done all the planting and watering and weeding anyhow, would go out to the tiny garden and dig up the smallest potatoes in Ireland, all because Jamie was too lazy to dig a larger garden and had no money to buy good potato seed.</p>

        <p>Then poor Eileen wrenched her back and was laid up in bed.<span class="spoken"> "St. Bridget and the Virgin Mary herself must have smiled on Eileen O'Rourke,"</span>the village women said.<span class="spoken"> "Why, it's the first rest she's had since she married that Jamie O'Rourke!"</span></p>

            <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="content">
        <p>With Eileen in bed, Jamie began to worry. No Eileen to dig meant no praties all winter, and no praties meant no food.</p>

        <p><span class="spoken">"Oh, poor me,"</span> wailed Jamie. <span class="spoken">"I'll starve to death. I'd best go to the church and confess to Father O'Malley. There's no telling how soon old Death will be knockin' on me door."</span></p>
        <p>So, even though it was mignight, Jamie set out for the church. He was about halfway down the hill when he heard singing and a tap, tap, tapping sound.</p>
