# Assignment 07
## Caroline Gancarz

1. Divs are tags used to define a division or section in an HTML document. Classes used to outline the same style of elements containing the same class name. Ids signify HTML elements with unique ids/names (they help differentiate between different HTML elements). Spans are tags used in grouping inline elements in an HTML document.

2. Alt text is useful when a user cannot view the displayed image on the web page. This is useful in times of slow connection, displaying error or screen reader use. The user can still hover over the image to get an idea of what the original image was intended to display.

3. This assignment proved somewhat difficult for me only because I am trying to "get ahead" the class with more difficult formatting! I am definitely making more work for myself, but enjoying the process at the same time :)
This round I was able to utilize codepen online a lot more than ever (since you showed me this magical world, Justine)so I could visualize changes way faster than saving my work in Atom, and refreshing my live page. This tool has been awesome! I took a systematic approach to setting up my divs first and filling in whatever I needed going from there. I a still having a little trouble recognizing second classes and how to use them, but hope to do so soon. Thanks!
