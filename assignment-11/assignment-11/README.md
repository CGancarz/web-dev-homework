# Assignment 11
## Caroline Gancarz

1. Padding ensure an element on a page has buffer room and it is absolute, even when the page size is manually adjusted. A margin is an indentation specific to an element displayed, but it is not static in that it will change with a page's size - it will be concrete no matter the page size. Borders are used to encompass an element be it an image, box, text, div etc. Borders can be used to help adjust displayed shape.

3. This assignment was challenging but rewarding (and I even managed to finish on time!) I am finding that fonts are still not my forte, but positioning and advanced format/styling I love! I wanted this layout to be a bit more challenging and fit my idea of aesthetically pleasing (which by the way, I have questions for you about Justine!) I had a lot of trouble initially because I didn't realize Chrome would not display some of my selected properties, however, in the last day I have been able to fine-tune the overall page look. Stacked online has been a great resource to see what has and has not worked for others. I had to have a few display pages going and constantly save/refresh to see my progress, but overall I am happy with the outcome. I initially used codepen to play out my styling/formatting choices, but after realizing chrome would not display what I wanted, I had to go back and scrap my work. Bummer!
I also realize I don't really know much about github and am TERRIFIED of losing precious work - which I already did today :( So to be completely honest, it will not look like it should until I see you in person. My bad!!
