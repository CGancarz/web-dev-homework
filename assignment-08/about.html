      <h2>It's A Spud's (Life) History</h2>
    <p>
      "The potato is a root vegetable, a starchy tuber of the plant Solanum tuberosum, and the plant itself, a perennial in the family Solanaceae, native to the Americas.
      <br><br>
      Wild potato species can be found throughout the Americas, from the United States to southern Chile. The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by indigenous peoples of the Americas independently in multiple locations, but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes. In the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia, from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex, potatoes were domesticated approximately 7,000â€“10,000 years ago. In the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.
      <br><br>
      Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish. Today they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply. As of 2014, potatoes were the world's fourth-largest food crop after maize (corn), wheat, and rice.
      <br><br>
      Following millennia of selective breeding, there are now over 1,000 different types of potatoes. Over 99% of presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile, which have displaced formerly popular varieties from the Andes.
      <br><br>
      The importance of the potato as a food source and culinary ingredient varies by region and is still changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe, especially Northern and Eastern Europe, where per capita production is still the highest in the world, while the most rapid expansion in production over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia, with China and India leading the world in overall production as of 2014."

      <h2>What's So Great About Spuds?!</h2>
    <p>
      The reason behind my life-long obsession with potatoes is quite simple: They are AMAZING! Potatoes are hands-down the most versatile vegetable in existance, used in nearly every cuisine from around the world. The humble spud has gone long enough forgotten in dark cubbards to rot, being treated as a second-rate guest on the dinner plate: this is it's time to shine! Did I mention that there are over 200 varieties available globally, they make up large portions of vegetarian & vegan diets, and are naturally cholesterol free? Not only are there hundreds of these lil' guys to choose from, they can be part of a well-balanced diet, and are affordable on every budget, including some of the "fancier" varieties. Just the other day, I was able to buy a 10# bag of Idaho Russet potatoes for $0.99! How many foods can you get for such a value these days?
      <br><br>
    The bottom line is - I want to rekindle the love people have for potatoes! Whether fried, baked, boiled, mashed, steamed, roasted, stewed, or made into hearty salads, smothered with cheese, sourcream, butter, made 'loaded' or prepared simply, there is yet to be a person I've met who has not liked potatoes in some way, shape, or form. I want to get people thinking about, talking about, buying, eating, and enjoying potatoes again!
