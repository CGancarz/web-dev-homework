    <h2>Tools & Supplies</h2>
      <ul><li>3 pounds small red or white potatoes</li>
          <li>1/4 cup <strong>GOOD</strong> olive oil</li>
          <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

          <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol><li>Preheat the oven to 400&#176; F.</li>
          <li>Cut the potatoes in half or quarters and place in a bowl with
            the olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic; toss until the potatoes
            are well coated. Transfer the potatoes to a sheet pan and spread
            out into 1 layer. Roast in the oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour
            or until browned and crisp. Flip twice with a spatula during
