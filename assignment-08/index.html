      <h2>Container Planting (for the rest of us peasants)</h2>
      <p>
        <pre>
    1. Using a recommended 5 gallon or larger plastic bucket/container, drill 10-12 evenly spaced drainage hole in the bottom.
            (Pro Tip)! --> Use pallets, cinder blocks, or bricks to elevate container from bottom once planted for even better drainage!
    2. Fill bottom of container with 4-6 inches quality soil-compost mixture. This can be premade or purchased directly from a reputable nursery or big-box
    store.
    3. Add a dusting of sulfur powder to this soil level to help deter bugs and decrease the chances of your spud seeds rotting in moist soil.
            (Did you know)? Sulfur increases the acidity of soil just enough to keep your spuds happy as they grow?
    4. Place the seed potatos onto the bottom soil layer - They should have their own space and NOT touch.
            (IMPORTANT!) Cut side planted up, eye side down.
    5. Add 3-4 more inches of soil-compost mixture on top of the seed potatoes and press soil down gently. Ensure large air pockets around the seeds are
    filled in with the soil mixture.
    6. Water initially lightly. The soil should be dense feeling but not turn to mud!
    7. In roughly two weeks, sprouts should emerge from the top of the soil layer. Add another 1" or so soil mixture every week or so until the sprouts are
    tall enough to have a visible 8" mound around them.
    8. Harvest your potatoes at the end of the season and enjoy!
            (Pro Tip)! Potatoes will stay fresh for longer when kept in an area out of direct sunlight and without extreme temperature fluxuations.
                *The fridge is NOT suitable for spuds! Ideally keep them in a pantry or cubbard.
