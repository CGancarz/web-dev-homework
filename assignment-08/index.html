      <h2>"Put 'em in the Dirt!" - If you've got the land!</h2>
    <p>
      <pre>
    1. With a hoe or round-point shovel, dig a trench about 6 inches wide and 8 inches deep, tapering the bottom to about 3 inches wide.
          üôå (Pro Tip)! --> Potatoes are best grown in rows. Space rows about 3 feet apart.
    2. Spread and mix in rotted manure or organic compost in the bottom of the trench before planting.
    3. Cut large potatoes into pieces that are roughly the size of a golf ball, making sure that there are at least 2 eyes on each piece.
    4. In the trench, place a seed potato piece, cut side down, every 12 to 14 inches and cover with 3 to 4 inches of soil.
          üôå (Pro Tip)! --> Potatoes that are smaller than a hen‚Äôs egg should be planted whole. Also, If you are cutting up potato pieces for planting, do so 1 to
            2 days ahead of time. This will give them the chance to ‚Äúheal‚Äù and form a protective layer over the cut surface, improving both moisture retention
            and rot resistance.
    5. 12-16 days after planting, sprouts will appear. Use a hoe to loosely fill in the trench with 3 to 4 inches of soil, leaving a few inches of the plants exposed.
    6. Repeat in several weeks, leaving the soil mounded up 4 to 5 inches above ground level.
    7. After the potato plants have emerged, add organic mulch between the rows to conserve moisture, help with weed control, and cool the soil.
    8. At the end of the season, call all your friends & neighbors to help harvest your mountain of tubers!

      <h2>Bucket Planting (for the rest of us peasants)</h2>
      <p>
        <pre>
    1. Using a recommended 5 gallon or larger plastic container, drill 10-12 evenly spaced drainage hole in the bottom.
            üôå (Pro Tip)! --> Use pallets, cinder blocks, or bricks to elevate container from bottom once planted for even better drainage!
    2. Fill bottom of container with 4-6 inches quality soil-compost mixture. This can be premade or purchased directly from a reputable nursery or big-box
    store.
    3. Add a dusting of sulfur powder to this soil level to help deter bugs and decrease the chances of your spud seeds rotting in moist soil.
            üí° (Did you know)? Sulfur increases the acidity of soil just enough to keep your spuds happy as they grow?
    4. Place the seed potatos onto the bottom soil layer - They should have their own space and NOT touch.
            ‚ö†Ô∏è(IMPORTANT!) Cut side planted up, eye side down.‚ö†Ô∏è
    5. Add 3-4 more inches of soil-compost mixture on top of the seed potatoes and press soil down gently. Ensure large air pockets around the seeds are
    filled in with the soil mixture.
    6. Water initially lightly. The soil should be dense feeling but not turn to mud!
    7. In roughly two weeks, sprouts should emerge from the top of the soil layer. Add another 1" or so soil mixture every week or so until the sprouts are
    tall enough to have a visible 8" mound around them.
    8. Harvest your potatoes at the end of the season and enjoy!
            üôå (Pro Tip)! Potatoes will stay fresh for longer when kept in an area out of direct sunlight and without extreme temperature fluxuations.
                ‚ö†Ô∏èThe fridge is NOT suitable for spuds! Ideally keep them in a pantry or cubbard!‚ö†Ô∏è
