1. HTML was a bittersweet learning experience. It made me realize that minor details can either make or break your entire code and it is a HUGE pain to go back and forth in trying to find a simple misspelling, lack of punctuation, etc that caused your HTML code to be inactive in the first place! I appreciate having had to learn a lot about it, but am definitely ready to move on to something more user friendly :)
2. I am SO READY FOR CSS!! I've already begun implementing it in use since it makes a lot more sense to me and keeps my coding page looking much less cluttered. I definitely want to learn a lot of the weird/unusual components of elements because a challenge is great for me. Who knew I'd end up really loving web design?! I sure didn't but I'm glad we've gotten this far!
3. My work cycle this round was TOUGH! I had a lot of going back and fourth trying to troubleshoot what went wrong in the code. Definitely a tiring process (and I should have started this project sooner), but nonetheless rewarding when looking back at what I first started with! Let's move on to CSS. I am so ready!
