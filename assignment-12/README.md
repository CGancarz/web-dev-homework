1. My imaginary client is a person selling "designer" potato sacks (I know, strange...) They wanted a clean minimalist aesthetic to highlight their products. I wanted to emulate this website I came across that I thought was absolutely outstanding: https://www.rexvintagestore.com/edit-08/ like WOW, just wow!
2. Display sets an element inner and outer type. Display block puts elements into blocks while inline causes them to line up in a specific orientation. Display inline-block allows to set a width and height on an element, including the top and bottom margins and paddings.
3. I started from scratch for almost all my elements. I really tried to follow the above website in terms of styling elements but the sourcecode is vast and confusing. I went with a similar aesthetic and kept checking back after saving changes to view results live, but was able to achieve a similar look with less code. I did not want to make a drop down menu because it did not go with the look I was aiming for - sorry!
