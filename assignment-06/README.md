1) Most home web pages I've come across appear to have some type of data collection or another. Most commonly it is in applications such as what we learned to do - to pass along information to the page-master regarding who or what is coming in contact with the web page. The use of forms are essentially for statistical collection of data and information. The most common website form is considered a search box or search engine - this gives a statistical display of the most search item/term from that given website.

2) An example of a text is autofocus in which the browser's focus is on a specific area of text to be filled in by the person browsing the web page. A selection narrows down the text and gives the user more concrete specifications to choose from. Buttons are use in web design to add enticement to the user via clicking. This can link other website and pages from the original, giving the web user a guided path along which they are directed. These elements of web design are universally used throughout good websites. It is rare for a page to have simply a small list of information and no alternative means of contact, search, or inquiry. values

3) This work cycle went relatively smooth- I did not rely so heavily on checking back and forth from the pages to ensure I saw proper changes on the webpage. I would still like to know how to link buttons as I had a very difficult time with this. Other than that, using the basics and knowledge after reading the homework section is very helpful.
